# Instacart Basket Analysis
## Project Overview / Objective:
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, currently has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about the sales patterns. Specifically, stakeholders are interested in the variety of customers in the database as well as any purchasing behaviors in order to potentially considered targeted marketing strategies. As an analyst, perform an iniital data and exploratory analysis of the data provided in order to derive insights and provide further suggestions on strategies for better segmentation based on the provided data. 

## Key Questions:
1. The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
2. Are there partiular times of the day when people spend the most money?
3. Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. How can product price ranges enhance marketing strategies?
4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
5. What is the distribution among users in regard to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to instacart)?
6. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?
7. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
8. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
9. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest (i.e., age, income, certain types of goods, family status)?
10. What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
